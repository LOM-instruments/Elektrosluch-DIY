# Elektrosluch-DIY

This is a repository with resources for making a basic version of [Elektrosluch](https://zvukolom.org/elektrosluch) on a perfboard.

"*.diy" files are made in [DIY Layout creator](https://code.google.com/archive/p/diy-layout-creator/) and ".sch" files come from [Eagle CAD](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/). Downloading this software will only be necessary if you need to edit those files.
